    b) To run the btree part you will need to install the module named Btress (https://pythonhosted.org/BTrees/).
    c) The commands to run the code are:
        i) python3 1_hash_vvb238_nr2229.py
        ii) python3 1_btree_vvb238_nr2229.py
    d) These two commands will generate two files each containing the time taken to run the 60 commands and the updated table.

Question 3:
    a) Both files have a variable on the top named "datafile" which is supposed to contain the file name where the data is kept.
        (Please make sure the path is correct)
    b) To run the code you will need to install the module named mysql (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html).
    c) The commands to run the code are:
        i) python3 3a_vvb238_nr2229.py
        ii) python3 3b_vvb238_nr2229.py
    d) These two commands will generate a file containing the time taken to input the 100,000 records.
